### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was where it all started and I am grateful that this was the first thing I learned. std::cout << “ “ is something I will always remember. I remember it being kind of difficult to navigate and figure out the different terms but it makes more sense nearing the end of the semester. 

* Lab 5

    In lab 5 I was able to utilize double and the different functions that we are able to use in C++. Just in case I ever forget how to find an area of a rectangle or if I ever forget how to read a decimal in terms of feet, I know I will always have this code with me. I also remember that this was one of the first times using if and else if. 


* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a lab that really stuck with me because it taught me that the terminal can read the amount of arguments that it's presented with and that it can respond based on that. I was also interested in how blackjack worked in technical terms so building the rules myself really helped me to understand it.
