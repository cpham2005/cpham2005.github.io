### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was where it all started and I am grateful that this was the first thing I learned. std::cout << “ “ is something I will always remember. I remember it being kind of difficult to navigate and figure out the different terms but it makes more sense nearing the end of the semester.
